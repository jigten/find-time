# Find Time

Find Time is a full-stack web application that allows users to find the best time to hold a meeting. After logging in with a Google account, users can define a time range and an attendee list, and then see a list of all the available meeting times.

The application uses the following stack:

- React for client side
- Node.js with Express for server side
- PostgresQL for database
- Prisma for ORM
- Docker
- Webpack
- Nginx as a reverse proxy
- Google OAuth for authentication
- Sass
